        <td> <h2> Poodle</h2>
        	<p></p>If you're used to miniature or toy poodles, you might be taken aback at the size of a standard poodle. They can weigh up to 70 pounds and reach nearly two feet in height.</td>

		<td> <h2> Australian Shepherd</h2>

        <td> <h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2>
        	<p></p>These beautiful dogs are strong and energetic, according to the AKC. They love to play and enjoy running around, so they aren't a great fit for someone who's looking for a dog to relax with. But if you have a yard with a lot of space and love going on walks and hikes, one of these pups could be a great companion.

		<td> <h2> Great Dane</h2> 
		<p>The "Great" in this breed's name isn't for nothing. Great Danes can grow up to 32 inches tall and even the females weigh over 100 pounds. But despite their size, these dependable, friendly canines are just gentle giants at heart. I have a great dane right now and her name is cleopatra. She gave birth 2 weeks ago to 9 puppies.</p> </td>

        <td> <h2>Aspin</h2>
        	<p></p>Aspins are warm, friendly, playful and affectionate, and would be a loyal member of any family, returning their owner's love tenfold. Formerly considered a “lesser dog” to their pedigree counterparts, Aspins are now receiving more and more recognition within the Philippines.</td>
